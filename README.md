Ride Booking iOS App

This repository contains the solution to the assigned tasks for building a ride-booking iOS app using Swift. The project demonstrates form handling, business logic implementation, and API integration while adhering to clean coding practices.

Task 1: Build a Ride-Booking Form

A form collects the following user details:

Name

Pickup Location

Drop-off Location

Implements input validation:

Name cannot be empty.

Pickup and drop-off locations cannot be the same.

Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

Displays a success  custom alert with booking details when the "Book Ride" button is pressed.

Task 2: Fare Calculation Function

A function to calculate the ride fare based on distance and car type.

Supported car types: Economy, Luxury, SUV.

Handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative distance, unsupported car types)

Task 3: Fetch and Display Data from REST API

Fetches available ride options from a mock API endpoint (Mocky).

Displays car details (image, title, production year, class, and fare) in a scrollable list.

Handles loading states and errors gracefully.
